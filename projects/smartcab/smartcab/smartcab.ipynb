    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "\n",
    "The next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (None, 'forward', 'left', 'right') at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, enforce_deadline to False and observe how it performs."

At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the self.state variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcement enforce_deadline being set to False, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses."

    "**ANSWER**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The identified state consists of all the inputs plus the next waypoint. The following are its parameters:\n",
    "+ light\n",
    "+ oncoming\n",
    "+ right\n",
    "+ left\n",
    "+ waypoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, our problem is to get our smartcab to a specified location in our grid world. Normally, this would be much more complicated. However, pathing has already been solved for us by the planner module as it already tells us where the next waypoint is. This also effectively let's us bypass the problem of localization, so we don't have to worry about sensing and ascertaining where our smartcab is exactly. What we do have to worry about is the conditions of its immediate vicinity (the inputs) and where it must go next (next waypoint). So the inputs plus the waypoint is all we need really to take an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parameter can take on the following values:\n",
    "+ light ['green', 'red']\n",
    "+ oncoming, right, left [ None, 'left', 'right']\n",
    "+ waypoint [ None, 'left', 'right']\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, altogether there are 2x3x3x3x3 = 162 total states. It's a small number compared to possible events that can occur in a real world environment. If we were to take account different vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, weather, road elevation, etc., it would certainly be a lot more than 162 states."

    "### Implement a Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "With your driving agent being capable of interpreting the input information and having a mapping of environmental states, your next task is to implement the Q-Learning algorithm for your driving agent to choose the best action at each time step, based on the Q-values for the current state and action. Each action taken by the smartcab will produce a reward which depends on the state of the environment. The Q-Learning driving agent will need to consider these rewards when updating the Q-values. Once implemented, set the simulation deadline enforcement enforce_deadline to True. Run the simulation and observe how the smartcab moves about the environment in each trial."

    "The smartcab's behavior would start out random but would slowly correct itself once negative rewards were encountered. For example, after it runs a stop light and receives a negative reward, it would stop doing that and try something else the next time around. This is because the Q-value of that state-action pair is degraded and is seen as a less appealing option by the smartcab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the cab encounters more common cases first (usually without traffic) and therefore has Q-values for those states-action pairs first. It can get confused when it encounters an entirely new state as the actions for that state will always start out with uniform Q-values. For example, even though it ran a stop with no traffic before and got a negative reward, if there was suddenly any traffic in any direction, it's possible that it will run the stop again so it can seemingly make the same mistakes."
